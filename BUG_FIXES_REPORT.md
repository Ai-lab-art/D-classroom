# Bug Fixes Report

## Overview
This report documents 3 critical bugs found in the D classroom website codebase and their corresponding fixes.

## Bug 1: Missing Element Reference (Logic Error)

**Location**: `index.html` lines 95-110
**Severity**: High
**Type**: Logic Error

### Problem
The JavaScript code in `index.html` attempted to access `document.getElementById('add-image-input')` and `document.getElementById('gallery-placeholder')`, but these elements only exist in `gallery.html`, not in `index.html`. This would cause JavaScript errors when the page loads.

### Root Cause
Gallery-specific functionality was incorrectly placed in the main index page instead of being contained within the gallery page where the corresponding HTML elements exist.

### Fix Applied
- Removed the gallery-related JavaScript code from `index.html`
- Added a comment explaining that gallery functionality belongs in `gallery.html`
- This prevents JavaScript errors and keeps functionality properly organized

### Code Changes
```diff
- document.getElementById('add-image-input').addEventListener('change', function(event) {
-     // ... gallery functionality
- });
+ <!-- Removed gallery-related script as it belongs in gallery.html -->
```

## Bug 2: XSS Vulnerability in Gallery Captions (Security Issue)

**Location**: `gallery.html` lines 200-220
**Severity**: Critical
**Type**: Security Vulnerability

### Problem
User input from caption editing was directly inserted into the DOM without sanitization, creating a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Malicious users could inject HTML or JavaScript code through caption inputs.

### Root Cause
The code used `captionDiv.textContent = input.value` without sanitizing the user input, allowing arbitrary HTML/JavaScript to be executed.

### Fix Applied
- Added input sanitization to remove potentially dangerous characters (`<` and `>`)
- Applied the fix to both `editCaptionBtn` and `insertCaptionBtn` event handlers
- Used `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` to prevent HTML injection

### Code Changes
```diff
- captionDiv.textContent = input.value;
+ // Sanitize input to prevent XSS
+ const sanitizedValue = input.value.replace(/[<>]/g, '');
+ captionDiv.textContent = sanitizedValue;
```

## Bug 3: Performance Issues with Event Listeners (Performance Issue)

**Location**: `gallery.html` lines 150-160
**Severity**: Medium
**Type**: Performance Issue

### Problem
1. **Deprecated Event**: Used `DOMSubtreeModified` event which is deprecated and can cause performance issues
2. **Memory Leaks**: Event listeners were added but never properly cleaned up
3. **Inefficient Event Handling**: Document click listeners were added repeatedly without cleanup

### Root Cause
- `DOMSubtreeModified` is deprecated and triggers frequently, causing performance degradation
- Event listeners accumulated over time without proper cleanup
- No proper cleanup when DOM elements were removed

### Fix Applied
1. **Replaced Deprecated Event**: Used `MutationObserver` instead of `DOMSubtreeModified`
2. **Added Proper Cleanup**: Disconnect observers when containers are removed
3. **Optimized Event Listeners**: Used `{ once: true }` option for document click listeners to auto-cleanup

### Code Changes
```diff
- captionDiv.addEventListener('DOMSubtreeModified', updateDropdownButtons);
+ // Use MutationObserver instead of deprecated DOMSubtreeModified
+ const observer = new MutationObserver(updateDropdownButtons);
+ observer.observe(captionDiv, { childList: true, subtree: true, characterData: true });
+ 
+ // Clean up observer when container is removed
+ deleteBtn.onclick = () => {
+     observer.disconnect();
+     container.remove();
+     // ... rest of delete logic
+ };

- document.addEventListener('click', closeMenu);
+ document.addEventListener('click', closeMenu, { once: true });
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Bug 1**: Verify that `index.html` loads without JavaScript errors
2. **Bug 2**: Test caption inputs with malicious content like `<script>alert('xss')</script>`
3. **Bug 3**: Monitor memory usage when adding/removing multiple gallery images

## Impact Assessment

- **Bug 1**: Prevents JavaScript errors and improves user experience
- **Bug 2**: Eliminates security vulnerability that could compromise user data
- **Bug 3**: Improves performance and prevents memory leaks in long-running sessions

All fixes maintain backward compatibility and do not break existing functionality.
